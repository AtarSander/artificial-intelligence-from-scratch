# Artificial inteligence algorithms from scratch
This repository contains from-scratch implementations of seven algorithms from various branches of artificial intelligence. Each implementation is tested and evaluated on a different task with in-depth analysis used hyperparameters and general conclussions about the algorithm in the form of report. Implemented algorithms are:
- gradient descent
- genetic algorithm
- alpha-beta pruning
- ID3 Tree
- neural net
- Q-learning
- naive bayesian classifier
