# Artificial inteligence algorithms from scratch
This repository contains from-scratch implementations of seven algorithms from various branches of artificial intelligence. Implementations are tested and evaluated on different tasks with in-depth analysis of used hyperparameters and general conclussions about the algorithm in the form of report. Each algorithm is a case study of different branch of AI, including:
- Optimization - gradient descent
- Evolution algorithms - genetic algorithm
- Two-player zero-sum games - alpha beta pruning
- Machine learning, classification - ID3 tree
- Deep learning - feedforward neural net
- Reinforcment learning - Q-learning
- Probablistic classifier - naive bayes classifier
